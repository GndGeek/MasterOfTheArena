MasterOfTheArena
================

A PRAW bot for the ArenaForumGame subreddit.

Setup Instructions
------------------
On Mac OS X: 

1. Download PRAW using easy_install or pip

1. * With easy-install, open Terminal, then type "easy_install praw" (without the quotes)

1. * I've never actually used pip, so... you can figure it out?

2. Download the program by clicking the ZIP button on this page.

3. Unzip it, and drag the MasterOfTheArena.py file to your desktop.

4. In the terminal again, type "python ~/Desktop/MasterOfTheArena.py" (again, without quotes.)

5. Enter your username and password at the prompts, then just leave the window open in the background.

***

On Linux:

Just follow the mac instructions, but you probably already know how to use a shell, and you might call it something other than Terminal.

***

On Windows:

I'll post directions here once I've figured it out. Give me a little while.
